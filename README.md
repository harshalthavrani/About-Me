Second-year computer programming student, future Full Stack Developer. My passion for computer programming brought me to the School of Applied Computer Science & IT at 
Conestoga College, where I am working on my Advance Diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis. Last semester I completed the Foundation program, covering C#, HTML, JavaScript, 
Access, MongoDB and Node.js. The most valuable lesson I have learned from Conestoga College has been the importance of writing down the flow of the program before moving into 
coding the program. Even though I knew I wanted to be a Full Stack Developer, I have enjoyed getting back to basics with HTML and CSS. My time in Highschool has provided me 
with great insights for a future career in programming. This year I have mastered ASP.NET, SQL Server, UML, and C#. I continue to build skills in ASP.NET and C#. Next year, 
I hope to complete a co-op work term as a Full Stack Web Developer, which will provide real-life experience and essential technological skills.
